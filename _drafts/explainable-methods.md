title: Explainable methods
---

# Definition

- There is no mathematical definition in understanding explainable AI
- There are several definitions for understanding the explainable AI
- Method can be further classifised by global and local
- Method for model agnostic and model dependent

## Interpretable models vs. Explainable models

# Methods

In general there are two types of methods:

1. Global model agnostic methods.
2. Global model dependent methods.

## Global Model Agnostic Methods

- Partial dependence plot
- Accumulated local effect plot
- Feature interaction (H-statistic)
- Functional decomposition
- Permuatation feature importance
- Global surrogate model

### Partial model agnostic method
