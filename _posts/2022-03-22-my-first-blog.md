# Fact 1: 

There is a direct correlation between the CO2 and the rise of surface temperature. 
Carbon dioxide emissions are considered the major contributor to the rise in global temperature. To understand if there is a relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and surface temperature, the following exploration shows a comparison between the rise in surface temperature and emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) with respect to time from the year 1880 to 2020.

# Fact 2:

The above graph presents the rise in surface temperature with respect to hemispheres (north and south) and globally. In comparison, the bottom graph presents the idea of global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in billion trillion kilotons from fossil fuels, industry, and land use changed over time. There is a clear correlation between carbon dioxide emission and a rise in temperature, especially carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry. There is a visual correlation between the rise of carbon dioxide emissions from industry and fossil fuels and the rise in temperature around the 1960s. The visualization comparison reveals the inter depended relationship between carbon emission and the rise in temperature.
