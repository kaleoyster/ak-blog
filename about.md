**Hello!**🖖

* 💻 🧪 I'm interested in computer science
* 📚    I'm currently ABD Ph.D. candidate at University of Nebraska at Omaha
* 🌁 I'm currently working on developing models to predict future bridge maintenances
* 🤖 I'm looking to collaborate on Ml/AI projects

I am strongly interested in the Data Scientist position at Waymark. As a Ph.D. student, my journey has deepened my belief that the narratives hidden within data depend on the modeling technique employed. Each modeling technique tells a unique story, making the selection of the proper technique and understanding the data essential in uncovering the story. My research efforts have been dedicated to developing various machine learning models and revealing, comparing, and explaining these narratives to those they matter most.

My multidisciplinary research experience involves collaborations with civil engineers, statisticians, and computer scientists. Through my work, I have identified influential factors and developed models to predict future bridge maintenance by ana- lyzing millions of inspection records spanning three decades, using various statistical, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. In a landscape where machine learning models are becoming increasingly complex, understanding, interpreting, and explaining these accurate yet opaque models is crucial in ensuring alignment with civil engineering knowledge and building trust. My collaborative efforts with the Nebraska Department of Transportation and the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center have developed methods that help us understand the drivers of bridge maintenance, evaluate bridge component performance, and compare insights across various models to guide decision-making. I have shared these insights with a broader audience through one-on-one meetings, conferences, and workshops, making mean- ingful contributions to civil engineering and computer science through publications.

Throughout my academic journey, I have also had the privilege of mentoring two master’s students and guiding them in developing methods for explainable artificial intelligence. These experiences have enhanced my leadership and teamwork abilities and reinforced my commitment to delivering results. My educational background has given me a solid academic foundation that I am eager to apply in a practical and dynamic work environment.

I recognize the importance of transitioning my expertise to the industry, and my academic experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in the skills and competencies required for the Data Scientist position at Waymark. I am confident I can leverage my knowledge and adaptability to make an immediate and meaningful professional impact. I am determined to succeed in this role and excited about contributing my expertise, problem-solving skills, and passion for innovation to your team.
